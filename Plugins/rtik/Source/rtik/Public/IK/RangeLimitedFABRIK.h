{
public:
	
	// Uses the FABRIK algorithm to solve the IK problem on a chain of rigidly-connected points.	
	//  
	// InTransforms is a list of transforms representing the starting position of each point. The 0th element
	// of this array is the ROOT. The last element is the EFFECTOR (sometimes called the 'tip' in code).
	//
	// The root point represents the start of the chain; its displacement from its starting position is limited.
	// The effector represents the end of the chain, FABRIK will attempt to move this to EffectorTargetLocation,
	// while maintaining inter-point distances.
	//
	// Each chain point, except the effector, has a CHILD - this is simply the next point in the chain. Correspondingly,
	// each point except the root has a PARENT, which is the previous point. The displacement between a parent and its child 
	// is loosely referred to as a BONE.	
	// 
	// FABRIK is an iterative algorithm. It will adjust each point in the chain in a forward-and-backward manner,
	// until either the distance between the effector and EffectorTargetLocation is less than Precision, or MaxIterations
	// iterations (up and down the chain) have been performed.
	//
	// In principal, FABRIK pays attention only to the location of each chain point, not their rotations. However, 
	// this is impractical when working with skeletal bones. Once the final locations of each chain point are 
	// determined, the rotation of each transform is updated as follows:
	// 
	// - Let P be a chain point which is not effector, and let C be its child, before FABRIK
	// - Let P' and C' be the corresponding chain points after FABRIK is applied
	// - Let Q be the shortest rotation from (C - P) to (C' - P')
	// - Add the rotation Q to the rotation of P'	
	//
	// In other words, the rotation of each point transform is updated with the smallest rotation to make it 
	// 'point toward' the newly adjusted child point.	
	//
	// The effector's rotation is NOT updated (unlike in the UE4 FABRIK implementation), you will need to do this
	// yourself after running FABRIK.
	//
	// Parameter descriptions follow:
	// 	
	// @param InTransforms - The starting transforms of each chain point. Not modified. Must contain at least 2 transforms.
	// @param Constraints - Constraints corresponding to each chain point; entries should be set to nullptr for points that don't need a constraint.
	//   Constraints are enforced each time a point moves.	
	//	 Strong constraints may degrade the results of FABRIK, it's up to you to figure out what works.
	// @param EffectorTargetLocation - Where you want the effector to go. FABRIK will attempt to move the effector as close
	//   as possible to this point.
	// @param OutTransforms - The updated transforms for each chain point after FABRIK runs. Should be an empty array. Will be emptied and filled with new transforms.  
	// @param MaxRootDragDistance - How far the root may move from its original position. Set to 0 for no movement.
	// @param RootDragStiffness - How much the root will resist being moved from the original position. 1.0 means no resistance; 
	//   increase for more resistance. Settings less than 1.0 will make it move more.
	// @param Precision - Iteration will terminate when the effector is within this distance from the target.
	//   Decrease for possibly better results but possibly worse performance.
	// @param MaxIterations - The maximum number of iterations to run. Increase for possibly better results but 
	//   possibly worse performance.
	// @param Character - Character pointer whcih may be used for debug drawing. May safely be set to nullptr or ignored.
	// @return - True if any transforms in OutTransforms were updated; otherwise, false. If false, the contents of OutTransforms is identical to InTransforms.
