As of Aug. 2017, Unreal contains a good but basic implementation of FABRIK. Some features it lacks are:
- ROM constraints
- Multiple effectors
- Closed loops
- Joint weighting

* Multieffector FABRIK
  Notes on using FABRIK with multiple effectors.

** Motivation
   - No multieffector support in UE4
   - Need multiple effectors to resolve upper body IK (cause there are 2 arms)
   - Arms will probably need to adjust a sub-base. Then I'll need to resolve this with the lower body.
   - Use closed loops? Or just sub-bases?
